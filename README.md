**Description**:
I prompt-engineered and LLM-integrated a unique, well-developed version of the snakes-and-ladders game, in 3-5 hrs, and deployed it to Netlify!

- **Netlify Deployment URL**: https://snakes-and-ladders-vc.netlify.app/my-app (most likely will not be active at the time you're viewing this, for the sake of saving on cloud billing costs)

- **What I Built**: A game of snakes-and-ladders with the following features-
  1. A total of 5 members can be added, and the members can either be human or CPU (and all human-members must play from the same computer)
  2. The min and max of the dice is customizable to any integer in the inclusive range of -99 to 99 instead of 1 to 6.
  3. The number of snakes and ladders in the game is customizable (default 8 each).
  4. Each new game uses a randomized arrangement of snakes and ladders.
  5. There is a statistics section that shows the following stats of each player: number of snake bites, number of ladder climbs, number of rolls, average dice value, and current position.
  6. There is a UI option to toggle the display of the actual snake/ladder graphics. 
  7. The game is suited for both light mode and dark mode
  8. Anytime there is a snake bite, ladder-climb, or finish-line-reached, an descriptive alert shows up for it.
